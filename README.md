# Marsden objective 1: non-destructive heDNA

## 1. Introduction

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive guide for the bioinformatic and statistical analysis of the ethanol comparison project, associated with the Marsden Fast-Start funding MFP-UOO002116.

## 2. Experimental design

The primary objective of this experiment is to assess the possibility of non-destructive heDNA recovery from museum-stored marine sponge specimens through DNA extraction from the ethanol in which specimens are stored. To verify non-destructive sampling as a suitable methodological choice for specimens across the phylum Porifera, we selected one specimen from the three major classes due to differing internal skeletal structures, including Hexactinellida (hexagonal silica spicules), Demospongiae (spongin), and Calcarea (calcium carbonate spicules). A detailed list with metadata for each specimen can be found below.

| Cat. # | Class | Species | Date | Latitude | Longitude | Depth |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 35574 | Calcarea | Petrobiona sp. | 09/02/2008 | -73.1245 | 174.3205 | 321 |
| 37535 | Demospongia | Homaxinella sp. | 24/02/2008 | -72.0093 | 173.2238 | 850 |
| 37124 | Hexactinellida | Rossella fibulata | 21/02/2008 | -72.5903 | 175.3423 | 479 |
